Use of Interface:-
=================
-> It is used to achieve total abstraction.
-> Since java does not support multiple inheritances in the case of class, by using an interface it can achieve multiple inheritances.
-> Any class can extend only 1 class but can any class implement infinite number of interface.
-> It is also used to achieve loose coupling.
-> Interfaces are used to implement abstraction. So the question arises why use interfaces when we have abstract classes?
-> The reason is, abstract classes may contain non-final variables, whereas variables in the interface are final, public and static.

// A simple interface

interface Player
{
    final int id = 10;
    int move();
}
