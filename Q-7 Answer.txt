Lamda Expression:-
=================
Yes, we can pass lambda expressions as arguments to methods in Java. This feature is made possible by functional interfaces. A functional interface is an interface that declares only a single abstract method.

When a method parameter requires a functional interface, you can pass a lambda expression that matches the signature of the abstract method defined in the functional interface.

Ex:-

@FunctionalInterface
interface MyFunction 
{
    void performAction();
}
class MyClass {
    public static void perform(MyFunction function) 
    {
        function.performAction();
    }
}
public class Main
 {
    public static void main(String[] args) 
    {
        MyClass.perform(() -> System.out.println("Performing action using a lambda expression."));
    }
}

The MyClass class has a static method perform() that takes an instance of MyFunction as a parameter and calls the performAction() method on it.

In the main() method, we pass a lambda expression () -> System.out.println("Performing action using a lambda expression.") as an argument to the perform() method. This lambda expression matches the signature of the performAction() method in the MyFunction interface.

When the perform() method is called, it executes the code within the lambda expression, resulting in the specified action being performed.
